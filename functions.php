		1 => 'A full term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks (280 days) and is divided into three 13 weeks sections or trimesters.  The timeline starts from the first day of your last menstrual period.  Your first day of pregnancy is the first day of your last menstrual period.',

		4 => 'Chances are, you\'re just about to miss your period.  You\'re probably eager to get a pregnancy test.  While many home pregnancy tests are fairly accurate, they can\'t always pick up that you\'re pregnant only minutes after you miss a period.  If you get an initial positive result, then congratulations.  Now you should call your midwife or ob to schedule your first pre-natal visit.   If you get an initial negative result and your period still hasn\'t returned in a day or two, try another home pregnancy test.  Or you can try contacting your midwife or doctor to have them do a blood test that will more accurately confirm your pregnancy suspicions.  Some women are comfortable shouting their pregnancy news from the rooftops and some prefer to keep the news quiet for several more weeks until they\'re through the first trimester.  How you handle it is up to you.<br /><br />',
		5 => 'You may have just found out you\'re pregnant.  If so, congratulations!  This is an incredibly exciting time full of changes and wonder.   Many women wonder when to begin telling the world they\'re pregnant.  This is completely a personal choice.  The further you are in your pregnancy, the less likely you are to lose the pregnancy.  If you decide to go ahead and share the news, go ahead.  Just prepare yourself that the more people who know the news will also need to be told in the off chance you lose the pregnancy.  Many women choose to wait until the end of their first trimesters to tell the news, which is the beginning of the 13th week.  <br /><br />What\'s happening with your body?  <br /><br />Your breasts may be tender or sore.  You may begin to feel fatigued and will likely notice an increase in urination.  Many women also experience queasiness.  Again, these are general symptoms.   If you do feel these symptoms, it is often regarded as a good sign of a healthy pregnancy.   If you experience only one or none of these symptoms, it is not necessarily cause for concern – and you can certainly speak with your midwife or ob if you are concerned.  Each pregnancy is individual…even if you\'ve been pregnant before.  <br /><br />What\'s happening with your baby?  <br /><br />The baby is going through what is considered the most the crucial development stage with the extreme cellular division.  He\'s about the size of a head of a needle, and he looks more like a tiny tadpole than a human. <br /><br />The neural tube will become your baby\'s brain, spinal cord, nerves, and backbone from the ectoderm (the outermost layer of the fetus). His hair, nails, skin, mammary and sweat glands, and tooth enamel will also develop from this layer.<br /><br />The mesoderm, or middle layer, will become his heart and circulatory system.  And his heart is now beginning to divide into chambers, beat and pump blood. The muscles, cartilage, bone and subcutaneous tissue (under skin tissue) will from this layer.<br /><br />The endoderm, which is the third layer, will form his lungs, intestines, and urinary system, along with the liver, thyroid and pancreas.',
		6 => 'You\'re now at week 6.  The heartbeat can be seen and heard during a trans-vaginal ultrasound.  This is very exciting for many women.  If you have this ultrasound, be sure to bring your partner with you, along with some tissues!  That 100-160 beats-per-minute sound can often bring you to tears.  Now, don\'t expect to see whether you\'re having a boy or a girl at this stage.  It\'s way too early.  But it\'s fun to think about.  And if you\'re carrying multiples, this ultrasound is a good way for your practitioner to pick that up.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your body?  <br /><br />You may begin to notice moodiness or extreme emotional changes often due to rapidly increasing progesterone levels.  Fatigue may also really begin to set in, as will queasiness.  Some queasiness is actually caused or made worse because of a reaction to prenatal vitamins.  Your midwife or ob can switch your prenatal if you believe this may be happening to you.  If you are having trouble keeping food down or eating at all, don\'t worry…that little fetus is getting plenty of nutrition.  You can try eating small meals throughout the day.  Do your best to simply keep yourself hydrated.  Your blood supply continues to increase, which is part of the reason for your fatigue (as is the increasing progesterone).  Your digestion begins to slow down, which means you may feel constipated.  This sensation can continue throughout your pregnancy. <br /><br />Remember, this is all happening to allow your baby more time to get the nutrients he needs.  Spotting at this stage is not uncommon (can occur in up to 25% of pregnancies).  This isn\'t necessarily cause for alarm.  But you should contact your midwife or ob.  Some women have ectopic pregnancies, which is a pregnancy that develops in the fallopian tube, rather in the uterus.  These need immediate medical attention and symptoms include pain and even bleeding.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby?  <br /><br />Your baby is now about the size of pea (about ¼-inch).  You can begin thinking about kissing that little nose, mouth and those ears, because these are all just beginning to form. His heartbeat is about 100-160 times/minute.  That\'s about two times as fast as yours.  Blood is starting to course throughout his body.  The fetus has an oversized head and two dark spots indicating where the eyes will be, and two more dark spots indicating where that kissable mouth and nose will be.  He now has small indents on the side of his head where the ears will soon form.  His arms and legs look like nothing more than little stems protruding.  Tissue has begun to appear that will form his lungs, and his intestines are developing. The brain, muscles and bones are forming, along with his pituitary gland.',
		7 => 'If you have had a positive pregnancy test but haven\'t seen a midwife or ob, now is the time to go ahead and schedule your first appointment.  The first appointment consists of blood work and a physical exam, and perhaps a trans-vaginal ultrasound (or one may be scheduled later depending on your practitioner\'s recommendation). You\'ll also get the "official" estimated due date for your baby based on the 1st day of your last menstrual cycle.  The trans-vaginal ultrasound can also help in estimating the due date.  Remember, good prenatal care is a major part of a healthy pregnancy.  Now is a great time to make a list of all your questions about your pregnancy and take that with you to your first pre-natal visit.  <br /><br />If you are feeling cramping (not pain) as if you\'re getting your period, this is normal and you may feel this throughout the pregnancy.  You are likely not "showing" at this stage, though many women feel bloated and can notice a tightening of the clothes.  If it\'s your first baby, you likely won\'t show until closer to your 20th week.  If this is your 2nd or subsequent pregnancy, you may notice that you\'re starting to show much earlier than previous pregnancies. <br /><br />What\'s happening to your body?  <br /><br />You may be continuing to experience early signs of pregnancy, such as queasiness, fatigue, increased urination, constipation and breast tenderness.  Or not.  This is all part of the normal pregnancy process…due to increases in hormone levels or both estrogen and progesterone, a slowdown in digestion, increase in blood production, and an increase in fluids being passed through the kidneys, etc.  Increased urination will continue throughout the pregnancy, and may increase in frequency and volume.  About half of women experiencing queasiness will find that to ease as you enter your 2nd trimester – the rest will notice an easing about four weeks after that.  Your uterus has doubled in size since your pregnancy began.  Pay close attention to any spotting (which can occur in up to 25% of pregnancies) or pain you may experience and contact your midwife or ob if you have these symptoms.  These may be normal or may be a sign of something of concern.  Pay attention to your diet.  The better you eat, the better your baby eats.  Several meals throughout the day are always recommended over three large meals, and this often helps combat some of the queasiness you feel.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby?  <br /><br />Your baby is still growing and developing at an amazing pace.  Your tiny baby has doubled in size since last week and is now about the size of a blueberry (about ½-inch long).  Hands, legs and feet are developing, but don\'t have fingers and toes at this point, but you can still think about tickling them!  Your baby is considered an embryo still, because he still has something of a small tail (and extension of his tailbone).  This will disappear in just a few weeks.  Eyelid folds are beginning to appear and the eyes have some color.  The tip of his nose is sprouting as are tiny veins which would be visible under the skin if he was outside your womb.  The brain is quickly growing.  His liver is producing red blood cells until his bone marrow can take over the job.  His pancreas and appendix are forming.  The umbilical cord, which will carry oxygen and nutrients through the duration of your pregnancy, is developing from a loop of your baby\'s intestines.',
		8 => 'As you prepare for your 1st prenatal visit, continue to keep track of questions like genetic testing, proper nutrition and exercise, safe medications, sex, etc.  If you\'re not already on prenatal vitamins, be sure to pick some up from your midwife or ob (even before your 1st prenatal visit), or even grab an over-the-counter prenatal vitamin that contains folic acid.  Be sure to stay well hydrated throughout your pregnancy.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your body?  <br /><br />You may be experiencing enlarging and tender breasts and this will continue throughout your pregnancy.  You may find that you need to increased your bra size even a couple of times throughout pregnancy and possibly again after pregnancy when your milk comes in.  You may still be experiencing fatigue, so take a nap when given the opportunity.  You need the rest.  You\'re body is working overtime right now.   Increasing urination, slowed digestion and constipation continue as hormone levels jump.  Some women start to see the clothes tightening and find they want larger and/or more comfortable clothing.  Yoga pants are a favorite!<br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby?  <br /><br />Look, it\'s SpiderBaby!  Nope…that\'s just the webbed fingers and toes your baby now has.  Your constantly moving baby is about the size of a kidney bean.  His eyelids are covering his eyes, and he now has tubes that run from his throat to his developing lungs that will be used for breathing.  And that little "tail" is very nearly gone being replaced by his tailbone. Nerve cells are starting to branch out and connect.  External genitals have still not developed, so you won\'t yet know whether you\'re having a boy or girl.',
		9 => 'What\'s happening to your body?  <br /><br />You don\'t look pregnant yet, but your clothes may be feeling a bit more snug. You are most likely feeling pregnant.  Morning sickness and other symptoms of pregnancy are really apparent and you\'re likely feeling a huge range of emotions.  It\'s not uncommon to be feeling elated one minute and then feel terrified of parenthood the next. Your emotions are like a swinging pendulum. Don\'t worry-this is perfectly normal. It usually gets better during the second trimester (13-28 weeks). You will probably start feeling more emotional again as your pregnancy begins to wind down toward the end of your third trimester (28-41 weeks).<br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby?  <br /><br />Your little baby is almost an inch long (as big as a grape) and weighs a fraction of an ounce. He\'s beginning to look like a real person. All his little body parts are present and accounted for and will go through lots of changes and fine-tuning throughout your pregnancy.   His heart is now divided into its four chambers, and the valves are starting to form. Tiny little teeth are forming and that little "tail" is completely gone. His little organs, muscles, and nerves are now kicking into gear.  External sex organs are there but aren\'t recognizable as either male or female for another few weeks. His eyes are completely formed, but the lids are fused together and won\'t open until 27 weeks. The tiny earlobes, mouth, nose, and nostrils are more distinct.  And now the placenta is ready to take over the job of producing hormones. Your baby\'s basic physiology is in place and he\'s ready to start gaining weight.',
		10 => 'During your next prenatal appointment, your midwife or ob will listen to your baby\'s heartbeat through your belly with a handheld ultrasonic device called a Doppler. Get those tissues out again because hearing your baby\'s heart beating for the first time will surely bring you to tears.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />Before pregnancy, your uterus was the size of a pear. Now, it\'s as big as a grapefruit. Your clothing is tighter and your breasts may be uncomfortable in your bra. You may or may not be ready for maternity wear now.  The thickening in your midsection is probably due to some weight gain and bloating. <br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby is just over an inch long (from the top of his head to his adorable little bottom). Picture the size of a kumquat. He weighs under a quarter of an ounce. But don\'t let his tiny size fool you. He\'s already finished the most important part of his development. Now all his tissues and organs can begin to grow and mature. He\'s very busy in there. He\'s swallowing fluid and kicking (although you can\'t feel anything yet).  His liver is making red blood cells and his kidneys, intestines, and brain are beginning to function, though their development continues throughout your pregnancy.  He has tiny little nails beginning to form on his fingers and toes which are no longer webbed.  He can actually bend his arms and legs. If you could look inside, you\'d be able to see his spine through his translucent skin and the nerves of his spine stretching from his spinal cord. His forehead bulges to accommodate his developing brain (the bulging is temporary) and his head is half his body length. In the weeks ahead your baby will double in size – from 1¼ inches to almost 3 inches. Soft peach fuzz begins growing on his delicate skin.',
		11 => 'What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />By now you may notice that the nausea you\'ve been feeling is starting to fade. You may even have more energy. If you\'re like most women, you\'re feeling a bit more energetic.  You may also be more constipated and have more heartburn than usual (from increased hormone levels). Just keep in mind all this discomfort is for a good cause.  And now that the nausea has dissipated, you\'ll be able to eat regularly and gain the weight that is so necessary for your baby to thrive in utero (your uterus). <br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby? Y<br /><br />our baby is almost completely formed and about as big as a walnut. He\'s about 1 ½ inches long. His hands can open and close into fists, little tooth buds start to appear under the gums, his hands will soon open and close into fists,  and some of his bones are beginning to harden.',
		12 => 'What\'s happening to your body? Your midwife or ob can easily feel the size of your pregnant uterus on a pelvic exam (internal exam). If this is your first pregnancy you\'re probably still wearing your normal clothing but notice that you\'re more comfortable with loser fitting things. If this is not your first pregnancy, you\'ve probably pulled your maternity clothes out of the closet already. <br /><br />It is not uncommon to begin feeling heartburn, or acid indigestion (caused by the hormone progesterone which is now produced by the placenta. Remember, the placenta took over hormone production at about 9-10 weeks gestation).  Because the hormone progesterone causes relaxation of the valve between your esophagus and your stomach, gastric acid easily backs up. This is exacerbated when you are lying down. Some women take TUMS to help relieve this most annoying sensation (TUMS also provides calcium).  <br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby\'s reflexes have begun to develop.  His fingers will start to open and close, his toes to curl, his eyes clench, and his mouth can make sucking motions. His intestines have grown so that they protrude into his umbilical cord. His kidneys are now excreting urine. His face looks undeniably human. His eyes are now in the front of his head, and his ears are perfectly in place. He now weighs about ½ ounce and is about 2 inches long (from crown to rump). Imagine the size of a lemon or lime.',
		13 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby now has his fingerprints on his tiny fingertips, if you could peak inside you would be able to see his organs and veins through his very thin, translucent skin. He\'s just about 3 inches long and weighs about an ounce.  A girl already has more than 2 million eggs in her ovaries.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />You are beginning your 2nd trimester. This is a good time in your pregnancy as you notice nausea and fatigue subside and your libido increase due to the increasing blood volume in your body. And although birth is months away your breasts may have started making the nutrient filled colostrums (or fore milk) that will sustain your baby before your milk comes in.',
		14 => 'What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />Your uterus may be large enough to be pouching your belly out a bit. It\'s sitting just above your pubic bone. Starting to "look pregnant" is visible evidence that there really is a baby growing inside of you. It is one of the many thrills of pregnancy that is beyond description. Indulge in your daydreams and fantasies about your baby and trust that you are well on your way to having a normal, healthy baby. <br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />This week, your baby can actually make facial expressions like squinting and frowning. He may even be sucking his thumb. He is even able to pee, as his kidneys produce urine. He\'s also grasping. You may even be lucky enough to catch him sucking his thumb on an ultrasound.<br /><br />Other fun facts - Your baby measures 3 1/2 inches, and he weighs 1 1/2 ounces. His body\'s growing faster than his head, which now sits upon a more distinct neck. By weeks\' end, the length of his arms will be in proportion to his body-although his legs have not caught up yet. His body now has a covering of soft, very fine hair, called lanugo. His liver has started producing bile and his spleen is producing red blood cells.',
		15 => 'What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />You can easily expect about a 5 lb weight gain up to this point (that is an average. A bit more or less is fine). You\'re well into your pregnancy now. You may experience some nasal stuffiness and an occasional nose bleed. Chalk it up to those hormones again plus the added effects of an increase in your blood volume. If you look at the veins in your hands and arms you can easily see evidence of the large blood volume circulating throughout your body. And not too long from now, you will actually be able to feel your baby moving. If this is a subsequent pregnancy, you\'re more likely to feel him move sooner than a first time mom.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />He is now approximately 4 inches long and weighs about 2 ½ ounces.  His legs are longer than her arms now, and he is able to move all of his joints and limbs. His eyelids are still fused but he can sense light. In fact, If you were to shine a flashlight at your belly, your baby will probably move away from the beam. And although he can\'t taste anything yet, his taste buds are forming. At this point it may be possible to detect the sex of your baby on ultrasound. But it may still be too early. So don\'t be too disappointed. Much of this depends on the position of your baby.',
		16 => 'What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />If this is your first baby, your belly isn\'t visible to others yet. The ligaments (round ligaments) that support your uterus are thickening and stretching and may be causing some discomfort like sharp pains. This is especially noticeable with sudden movement and coughing. This is normal and nothing to be alarmed by. Luckily, the occasional discomfort of round ligament pain is offset by that "glow of pregnancy" being exuded. And soon, very soon, you will feel your baby moving inside of you. <br /><br />Much of the discomfort you feel can be related to your changing body shape and the increasing weight of your uterus. Backaches are quite common. A good pair of supportive shoes may help to alleviate some of this. And don\'t be too surprised if you begin to notice stretch marks on your abdomen and breasts. Try hard not to focus on your inevitable weight gain. By 20 weeks a doctor or midwife likes to see that you\'ve gained about 10 lbs. It is necessary for normal growth and development.  Remember that normal weight gain for the average pregnant woman is somewhere between 25-35 lbs.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby will have a growth spurt in the next few weeks. You can expect that he will double his weight and add inches to his length. Right now, he\'s approximately 4 ½ inches long and roughly 3 ½ ounces. His legs are more developed, his head is more erect, and his eyes are closer to the front of his head. His ears are just about in their final position. He\'s started growing toenails, too. His little heart is working hard pumping about 25 quarts of blood every day. This amount will only increase as your precious little baby continues to develop and grow into the beautiful baby you are so anxious to meet.',
		17 => 'What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />Starting to feel a bit off balance? As your belly grows, your center of gravity changes. This can sometimes cause you to feel a little unsteady on your feet. Be sure to wear a lower heeled shoe and try to avoid situations which may put you at an increased risk of falling. <br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby\'s cartilage is changing to bone and his umbilical cord, which transports nourishment, is growing thicker and stronger. He weighs about 5 ounces and is about 5 inches long.',
		18 => 'Your midwife or doctor most likely will order an ultrasound somewhere between 18-20 weeks. This ultrasound checks to see that your baby\'s anatomy appears normal. If any abnormalities are detected you will be referred to a specialist (perinatologist) for further investigation.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />Your cardiovascular system changes drastically during pregnancy. This causes a lowering of your blood pressure. Be sure to change position slowly. If you move too quickly you can easily feel a bit dizzy. When lying down, try to avoid lying flat on your back. The weight of your growing belly can inadvertently place pressure on your inferior vena cava (the large blood vessel responsible for carrying blood back to you heart, allowing for maximum blood flow to your baby). For this reason, it\'s best to sleep in a side lying position or partially tilted to one side.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby is roughly 5 ½ inches long and weighs almost 7 ounces. He\'s busy moving about  flexing his arms and his legs. You\'ll start noticing this more and more in the coming weeks. Myelin, the protective covering around his nerves has begun to form and continues to form for until his 1st birthday.  If your he is a she, you will be interested to know that her uterus and fallopian tubes are developed and in place. If you\'re having a boy his genitals are now identifiable. At this point an ultrasound can easily identify the sex of your baby.',
		19 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby\'s 5 senses are developing now so don\'t feel silly reading, singing, or talking aloud to him. Some research suggests he is able to hear your voice.<br /><br />He weighs about 8 1/2 ounces and measures 6 inches, head to bottom. His arms and legs are in proportions to the rest of his body now. His kidneys are continuously making urine and he\'s beginning to get hair on his scalp. Vernix, a thick protective coating is forming on his skin. Vernix functions like a moisturizer for your baby\'s sensitive skin and will protect it from wrinkling in the amniotic fluid.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />If you think you look pregnant now…just wait. You will start to grow even more quickly in the weeks ahead. You may feel lower abdominal achiness and occasionally a stabbing pain on one or both sides of your lower abdomen. This is typical of round ligament pain. Remember those are the ligaments deep in your pelvis that support the weight of your growing and stretching uterus. Yes, this is a normal occurrence. But if the pain is unusually severe don\'t hesitate to contact your midwife or doctor.<br /><br />You may also notice some skin changes. If the palms of your hands are red you can blame the estrogen. Do you have dark patches on your upper lip, cheeks, and your forehead? This is referred to as "the mask of pregnancy," or chloasma. Estrogen is responsible for this too. Some women notice that their inner thighs, underarms scars, and freckles appear darker too. And the dark line you may see running from your naval to your pubic bone is called linea negra. All these skin changes will probably diminish after delivery. But be sure you wear a good sunscreen because the sun can intensify these pigment changes.',
		20 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby now weighs approximately 10 1/2 ounces and measures 6 ½ inches from the top of his head to the tips of his toes (he\'s now being measured from head to toe rather than crown to rump. Before 20 weeks gestation his legs are curled against his torso making it difficult to measure him from head to toe). He\'s swallowing more now too. He\'s also producing meconium (a black, sticky by-product of digestion). This sticky substance will accumulate in his bowels, and will be excreted in his first few soiled diapers. Some babies pass meconium in the uterus during labor or during delivery).<br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />YAY!! You\'re at the halfway point in your pregnancy. You can actually feel the top edge of your uterus at the level of your belly button and will have gained approximately 10 lbs. As your circulating blood volume expands the hemoglobin (oxygen is transported through hemoglobin), a part of your red blood cells, will normally start to decrease. Iron is a mineral that\'s primarily responsible for making hemoglobin so be especially aware of foods that are rich in iron. There are many iron rich foods, both plant and animal based, so it should be fairly easy to optimize your iron stores without needing to take supplements.  An adequate amount of circulating hemoglobin will not only benefit the well being of your baby but it will also help your energy level and prepare your body for the inevitable blood loss during delivery.',
		21 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby weighs just under a pound and measures about 10 ½ inches long. You experience his movement as little flutters now but you\'ll be able to feel distinct kicking and punching in the next couple of weeks. You\'ll also become familiar with your baby\'s awake and sleep cycles. New anatomical developments include eyebrows, eyelids, and if you\'re having a girl her vagina is beginning to form. <br /><br /> <br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />Most women report that 2nd trimester is the best time in their pregnancy. You\'re not experiencing the discomforts of early pregnancy and your belly is not "too big." Enjoy the ride. You\'re probably feeling pretty comfortable these days because you\'re not too big yet and the usual discomforts associated with early pregnancy are, for the most part, gone. So, relax and enjoy- the third trimester can often be uncomfortable as your pregnancy winds down. <br /><br />Although 2nd trimester is typically the "best trimester" you may still have discomforts and annoyances. You may notice a susceptibility to varicose veins. Some relief measures for this common discomfort are elevating your feet when possible, sleeping on your left side, and wearing a good support hose. Some women also get spider veins. These are little tiny blood vessels at the surface of your skin, especially noticeable on your legs, face, or ankles. <br /><br />Many women experience a heightened sexual desire due to the increased blood volume and flow, particularly to the pelvic region. But it\'s also not uncommon to have little or no sex drive. Let\'s face it- aches, pains and fatigue can diminish anybody\'s sex drive.',
		22 => 'What\'s happening to my baby? <br /><br />Your baby weighs about 1 lb and measures about 11 inches.  His lips, eyelids, and eyebrows are becoming more distinguishable and he has tooth buds beneath his gums.  His eyes are now formed but they still lack pigment (color). <br /><br />What\'s happening to my body? <br /><br />A large majority of women develop stretch marks on their belly, hips, thighs, breasts, and buttocks. Moisturizing these areas may make you feel better if you\'re itchy but won\'t help prevent or lessen them. <br /><br />You may experience swelling in your hands and fingers too. If your rings are tight now it\'s probably a good idea to take them off before it\'s too late.',
		23 => 'What\'s happening to my baby? <br /><br />Your baby weighs a little over a pound and measures more than 11 inches. If you observe closely you may be able to see him squirming about. <br /><br />What\'s happening to my body? <br /><br />Your ankles and feet may also start to become swollen. This is called edema and is quite common. Edema is usually more pronounced towards the end of the day. You will probably notice much less swelling when you first wake up in the morning so remember to elevate those legs and avoid standing for long periods of time if possible. And always sleep on your side- preferably your left side to maximize circulation.  Keep in mind that a certain amount of swelling, or edema is expected. Excessive swelling may be a sign of a more serious problem known as pre-eclampsia, so consult with your midwife or physician before making any assumptions.',
		24 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby continues to grow steadily both in length and weight. His lungs are developing cells that produce a substance known as surfactant. Surfactant is responsible for inflating your baby\'s air sacs once he is born. His skin will also start to change and become less thin and translucent. <br /><br /> <br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />Your uterus is now visibly above the level of your bellybutton. Your midwife or doctor will be talking to you about blood work that needs to be done between 24-28 weeks. This lab work includes repeating some of your initial blood work plus a blood test that screens for gestational diabetes. This is called a glucose challenge test and is an essential lab value to ensure a healthy pregnancy outcome. Undiagnosed or untreated gestational diabetes can have serious ramifications. Gestational diabetes is a manageable and treatable condition in pregnancy so try not to worry to much if you get this diagnosis. It simple means that your physician or midwife (this is a condition of pregnancy that is co-managed) will require more surveillance of you and your baby. <br /><br />Your midwife or physician will also talk to you about the signs and symptoms of pre-term labor. These include cramping (feels like menstrual cramps) back pain, pressure, vaginal bleeding and leakage of fluid from your vagina. Some cramping, back pain, and pressure is normal but   it\'s always better to be safe and not sorry.  So if you are experiencing any of this, contact the office immediately. You also need to be aware of your baby\'s movements. Your baby should be moving throughout the day. Fetal movement is one of the best predictors of fetal well being.

		25 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby is about 13 1/2 inches and weighs about a pound and a half.  He\'s starting to look more and more like a newborn every day. His skin is much more supple, (looks more like "babyfat") and his hair is growing too. If you could take a peek inside you\'d be able to see your baby\'s hair color and hair texture. <br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />You may notice that your hair texture has changed too. Those trusty pregnancy hormones are what are responsible for a fuller, thicker head of hair. Don\'t get too used to it though.  It will start shedding after you give birth. <br /><br />You\'re probably finding it a bit more difficult to move around and you\'re probably moving a little less gracefully.

		26 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby\'s ears are becoming more sensitive to sound as the nerves in his ears become better developed.

If you\'re having elevated blood pressures your midwife or doctor will evaluate this further. A condition known as pre-eclampsia, a complication that is specific to pregnancy, is dangerous to you and your baby if not identified and treated promptly. <br /><br />As your uterus expands to accommodate the growth of your baby you may notice an increase in lower back pain. This is further exacerbated by weakening abdominal muscles, and hormonal changes that relax your ligaments and joints. Of course, the added weight gain only contributes to this very common discomfort. Pamper yourself at the end of your day with a warm bath or simply sit or lie down and relax. Make sure to carve out time for yourself now because once your baby is born you\'ll have a lot less time for relaxing and taking it easy.',

As your pregnancy nears the home stretch you\'ll most likely find that the discomforts you\'ve been experiencing up to this point are still there.

The increase in fatigue due to lack of sleep, and the influence of progesterone is going to contribute to mood swings too. 1 in 10 women may have depression so it\'s important to be able to distinguish between the two.  Be sure to discuss this with your midwife of physician during your pre-natal appointment with your practitioner. If you trust and respect your doctor or midwife, you can rest assured that she\'ll be doing her best for you and your baby on the day of delivery. If she\'s aware of your wishes and preferences (consider writing a birth plan), she can do her best to adhere to them. Another way to ease this fear is to hire a doula — a professional labor assistant — to attend your birth. She can be your advocate at the hospital.',
		31 => 'By now your baby is more than 16 inches long and weighs about 3.3 pounds .He is about to have a growth spurt.

These are called Braxton Hicks contractions. They should only last for approximately 30 seconds or less, are painless and infrequent. <br /><br />Colostrum may be leaking from your breasts.

		32 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />He\'s almost 3 ½ pounds, 17 inches long and occupying a lot of room in your uterus. You should only be gaining about 1 pound a week now and half of that is being used by your baby. He needs to fatten up now so he can survive outside of your uterus. His has toenails, fingernails and fuzzy hair too.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />You have almost doubled your blood volume since the beginning of your pregnancy in order to adjust to the increasing needs of you and your baby. Your uterus is pushing against your diaphragm causing shortness of breath and heartburn. Try eating smaller meals and sleeping with a lot pillows underneath you.',
		33 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby weighs about 4 pounds and is 17 inches long. He\'s a lot less wrinkled looking now too.

His lungs are still maturing but If he were to be born now he would probably do fine.

		36 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby is gaining about an ounce every day weighing in at about 6 lbs and measuring roughly 18 inches. Most of the soft fine hair (lanugo) and vernix (waxy protective skin covering) is shedding as your baby prepares for his arrival. Your baby will be considered "full-term" by the end of this week.<br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />Your baby is taking up a lot of space now so eating normal sized meals may be more difficult. Smaller, more frequent meals are often easier to handle at this point. On the brighter side, you may have less heartburn and be breathing easier due to a process called "lightening". This is when your baby "drops" down into your pelvis. Lightening typically occurs a few weeks before the onset of labor if this is your first baby. If you\'ve given birth before, it probably won\'t happen before labor starts. If your baby drops, you may also feel increased pressure in your lower abdomen, which may make walking increasingly uncomfortable, and you\'ll probably find that you have to pee even more frequently. <br /><br />If your baby is very low, you may feel lots of vaginal pressure and discomfort as well. You may be feeling more Braxton Hicks contractions too. These contractions are preparing your body for labor. Be sure to review the signs and symptoms of labor with your midwife or physician. But be sure to call if your baby is not moving well, your water breaks, or you have vaginal bleeding. Even if you\'re enjoying an uncomplicated pregnancy, it\'s best to avoid flying (or any travel far from home) during your final month because you can go into labor at any time. In fact, some airlines won\'t let women on board who are due to deliver within 30 days of the flight.',
		37 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />You are now "full term." If you go into labor now your baby is ready to live outside of your uterus. He weighs a little over 6 lbs and measures about 19 inches long. He may even have a full head of hair. <br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />Braxton Hicks contractions are more frequent and can be more uncomfortable. They will probably last a bit longer too. You may have an increase in vaginal discharge or perhaps some blood tinged mucous (if the bleeding is heavier than that you need to contact your midwife or physician). <br /><br />If possible, try to rest as much as your schedule allows.  And remember to be aware of your baby\'s movements.  It may be a little snug but he should still be active.',
		38 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby weighs about 6 ½ lbs and is over 19 inches long. He is ready to live in the outside world. You will soon be holding your baby in your arms and looking into his eyes. You may not be able to determine his permanent eye color however, if his eyes are brown, they will most likely stay brown. The iris (colored part of eye) of a newborn will usually gain pigment. It is unlikely the iris will lose pigment and get lighter. Dark blue or gray eyes may stay that color or change to green, hazel, or brown by the time your baby is 9 months old.  <br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />You are now waiting to go into labor. It\'s a waiting game, but be patient. Your body will do what it does naturally. Your midwife or physician will discuss inducing labor when he or she feels the time is appropriate.

		39 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />Your baby is waiting to meet you.  He\'s a little over 7 lbs and measures about 20 inches. His skins outer layer is sloughing off and new skin is forming underneath. <br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />Your body is getting ready for labor. Most midwives and doctors will do a pelvic exam during your pre-natal visit to assess the characteristics of your cervix (the portion of your uterus that opens during labor). They will be assessing the softness, thinning, and opening (ripening, effacing and dilatation) of your cervix. But even having this information can\'t predict exactly when your labor will begin. However, it is especially helpful when planning an induction. Your provider will begin fetal testing once you pass your due date.  Sometimes fetal testing is done even sooner, depending on the clinical circumstances. Always remember to monitor your baby\'s movements.',
		40 => 'What\'s happening to your baby? <br /><br />The average newborn weighs 7 ½ pounds and measures about 20 inches in length. Ultrasound can sometimes be helpful in assessing the weight of a full term newborn but can be off as much as a pound. The best and most experienced midwives and doctors have over or underestimated the weight of a newborn in-utero. Because your baby\'s skull bones aren\'t fused yet he is able to navigate your birth canal. This can cause your baby\'s head to look a bit squished when he is born. This is called molding and is only temporary. Rest assured that this little "cone head" will be perfect and round in just a day or two. <br /><br />What\'s happening to your body? <br /><br />You are ready to deliver. By now most women are tired of being pregnant and waiting anxiously to go into labor. Your midwife or doctor will be reviewing the signs and symptoms of labor as well as signs and symptoms of problems to be aware of. You are most likely having fetal testing such as non-stress tests (monitoring your baby on a fetal monitor) and biophysical profiles (an ultrasound evaluating the uterine environment and your baby\'s well being). If testing is normal you will probably be sent home to wait for labor. If a problem is detected, then you will be sent to the hospital for an induction. If you haven\'t delivered by 41 weeks then an induction will be scheduled. There are a few ways to induce ones labor and is dependent upon the quality of your cervix. This is something your practitioner will review with you before you\'re admitted to the hospital.'
